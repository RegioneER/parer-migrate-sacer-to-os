| CVE | Description | Severity | Solution | 
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| [CVE-2025-27363](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/1)|An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.|High|Upgrade freetype to 2.9.1-10.el8_10|
| [CVE-2024-56171](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2679)|libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a use-after-free in xmlSchemaIDCFillNodeTables and xmlSchemaBubbleIDCNodeTables in xmlschemas.c. To exploit this, a crafted XML document must be validated against an XML schema with certain identity constraints, or a crafted XML schema must be used.|High|Upgrade libxml2 to 2.9.7-19.el8_10|
| [CVE-2025-24928](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2679)|libxml2 before 2.12.10 and 2.13.x before 2.13.6 has a stack-based buffer overflow in xmlSnprintfElements in valid.c. To exploit this, DTD validation must occur for an untrusted document or untrusted DTD. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2017-9047.|High|Upgrade libxml2 to 2.9.7-19.el8_10|
| [CVE-2024-12085](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0324)|A flaw was found in rsync which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.|High|Upgrade rsync to 3.1.3-20.el8_10|
| [CVE-2025-4638](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4638)|A vulnerability exists in the inftrees.c component of the zlib library, which is bundled within the PointCloudLibrary (PCL). This issue may allow context-dependent attackers to cause undefined behavior by exploiting improper pointer arithmetic.Since version 1.14.0, PCL by default uses a zlib installation from the system, unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.|High|No solution provided|
